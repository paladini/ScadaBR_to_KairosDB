MySQL/MariaDB server up and running.\r\n2. KairosDB server up and running.\r\n3. ScadaBR database inside your server.\r\n\r\n**2) Run the script in your Terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T):**\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nchmod +x export.sh\r\n./export.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\n**3) Provide the credentials:**\r\n\r\nIn order to export the database, our Python script must know your database name, your username and your password for MySQL/MariaDB database.  \r\n\r\n- Dabase name: the ScadaBR database name. The default is `scadabr`.\r\n- Username: give the username you use to connect into to MySQL/MariaDB. The default is `root`.\r\n- Password: give the password you use WITH THE USERNAME PROVIDED PREVIOUSLY to connect to MySQL/MariaDB. The default is `` (empty).\r\n\r\nNow the script should do the work! Be patient and if you got any trouble, question, bug or want to suggest us a feature, feel free to contact me at fernandopalad@gmail.com (or via GitHub Issues).\r\n\r\nAbout\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nThis small script was developed by Fernando Paladini on 2015. Hope it help you :) \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
